/**
 * Intent provenance: did the developer ask for this, or did the agent invent it?
 *
 * The same command deserves a different verdict depending on the answer, which
 * makes this one of the cheapest useful signals available. It is also the one
 * most easily overclaimed, so the implementation stays deliberately literal:
 * it matches what the developer actually wrote, and defaults to
 * `agent_invented` when it cannot tell.
 *
 * Defaulting to `agent_invented` is the conservative direction -- Level 0's
 * fast-allow path refuses agent-invented actions, so an under-confident
 * classification costs a review, never an unchecked execution.
 *
 * This is a heuristic, not a proof. `classification-design.md` §13 lists
 * deciding `user_implied` vs `agent_invented` reliably as an open question.
